# Covid-19 Analysis using SQL, Excel & Tableau

This project seeks to create a report on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on a global scale. The two original datasets were imported into SSMS where different SQL queries were performed. Four new tables were created using the SQL queries which were then used to build the final Tableau report. 

Tools used:
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel 
- Tableau

Datasets: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
